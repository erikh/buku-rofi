# About
**buku-rofi** is a rofi wrapper for [buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku) the external CLI bookmark manager. It's a fork of [buku_run](https://github.com/carnager/buku_run) which I did because the original had bugs and was not actively mantained.

# Setup
Run `make install` or install through AUR or PKGBUILD.

# How-to
Run `buku-rofi`
